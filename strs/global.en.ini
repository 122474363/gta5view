EMSTR_194=Dear Michael,Very good seeing you yesterday. I want to stress how important it is that we continue therapy.~nrt~ We are on the point of a major breakthrough in your treatment. It's a fascinating process. When it seems pointless and exploitative is when therapy works the most! Life isn't meaningless. You're deeply troubled but together we can make you a functioning member of society. I recommends you keep taking the medication, continue to read the books I gave you and really try to understand what is causing these temper outbursts.  We'll crack you yet, amigo! We're in this together. As you know, I really enjoy working together – you're a fascinating man, Michael, but I'm afraid medicine in this country is not a charity, and with that in mind, I am afraid I am going to put my rates up again. Only by 75% which I think is very reasonable, given the stresses and strains of my work. Yours.~nrt~

Wow.~nrt~  But I didn't want to call as I'd only get sad and then afterwards I always do something I regret but maybe you don't need to no about that. I miss you, I think. We all do, sort of.  Fabien is so annoying. If I wanted to do yoga I'd like go to India or something. And he keeps asking me to cal him dad... only joking! See, I do have a sense of humor. My singing and dancing are going well but I'm really pissed that you screwed up fame or shame 4 me. Your such a dick.  Jimmy is useless. I wonder how him and I could come from the same place? was mom doing coke again when she was pregnant with me? Joke (or is it???!?)Anyway, we are all fine. Don't get a divorce. That would suck. I much prefer watching you 2 scream and fight. It's great and what I no. Miss you.LoveTraci!(ps – do you like this spelling of my name????! I think itz cute)~nrt~

EMSTR_222=Keep calm
EMSTR_223=Listen, I know you're probably irritated by the, shall we say, favor I just asked of you. I wish I hadn't had to involve you. But my boss has been sniffing around some old cases. I know we had a deal, but this is just a new agreement.~nrt~ I wish it were different but as I said, you broke out of my protection yourself when you started... doing your thing again. I made clear that would be a problem. You ignored me. I will do my best to protect you as a valued friend of my 'firm' but you're going to have to play ball. ~nrt~

EMSTR_229=Hmmm.
EMSTR_230=Listen, Michael, I'm so glad we're back together and making a go of things. After everything we've been through, I just couldn't give up on our family. Yes you're awful and clearly you're never going to change but I guess I want to bury you,~nrt~ when the time comes, as your wife. Please stop cheating on me, please stop hanging out with those people and please stop getting into the kind of trouble you're getting into. Go back to being the fat, depressing slob in therapy I loved! Okay, be the best you! That's what they say on Listen In. So do it. Or do something positive. Set an example to the kids. A better example. Listen, I REALLY think we should remodel the house again. Nothing expensive. What they call a 'quick gut' – it should really solidify our relationship. Either that or get a beach house. Think you find the sea very calming. xox~nrt~

For that I thank you. For not having to deal with Devin any more, I thank you. Do not fuck with me again. I hope that is clear. No reply necessary. Donald Percival~nrt~

I waited and I waited and nothing changed and now I'm seeing someone else and I'm finally happy.~nrt~ After all that I went through with my brothers passing, I know that life you live ain't for me. I always knew that. I ain't got the strength. I don't want it. I want something else and that thing ain't money. I guess what I'm saying is good bye. You'll always be my friend, you know that, but that is it. T~nrt~

Thought about calling but you never pick up so I did some digging and found you ain't been home cos ain't your home no more.~nrt~ You living up in Vinewood Hills, where you don't belong, boy. A word of goodbye would have been nice. Well, so you aware, I've been to the desert to get certified as a pelvic floor exercise instructor. I have been weak down there for so long. Well, no longer. Now I am strong and I will lead. And you are weak. Not just as a man, but as a person. You're really losing yourself, and I don't like it. You ain't got no respect. What if I want to put a women's Arts Center in the home? What if I want to start running pelvic floor classes myself there? Well as I always say, you come from trash, you stay trash and that's what you is, boy. I loved my sister, but boy did she make some mistakes, including in having you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I got boundless love to experience. Your aunt. ~nrt~

I know you got beef with OGs expecting nothing but hand outs and giving nothing back and I know that's a valid concern but let's keep things cool. Trust me, F. Trust me. I won't screw this up. We gonna make some serious paper & we gonna get respected. They ain't exclusive. You know I got your back. For ever.~nrt~

Either that or give yourself up. Prison ain't bad. In fact, I think you would love it. I still miss Mikey but he's in a better place. I ain't got a boyfriend, thanks for asking. That stuff ain't true about prison, unless you want it.
EMSTR_343=The truest of hearts break the cleanest

EMSTR_345=RE: The truest of hearts break the cleanest
EMSTR_351=What is a life worth?
EMSTR_352=Hello,You don't know me but we shared a moment of extreme and visceral intimacy.  I'm the woman whose life you saved from that crazy man outside the gas station.~nrt~  You're probably wondering how I found you.  Don't.  There's a threshold of wealth beyond which anything becomes possible.  My husband is the CEO of Bean Machine, the man who came up with the genius idea of turning coffee into junk food.  You did such a brave and selfless act and I wanted to do something equally brave and selfless in return.  However, after a lot of soul-searching, I have come up empty.  I think I've just been too rich for too long to quantify things in any other terms.  I was going to offer you free coffee for life but it tastes like burnt bath water and, let's face it, you'd probably prefer the money.  But what is a life worth?  What is a billionaire's life worth?  According to my husband, "low six figures".  So, by the time you read this email, you should be in the possession of $100,000 of Bean Machine stock.  I trust you will find this to be adequate compensation and will never approach me or my family again.  Best,Eileen~nrt~
EMSTR_353=SaeedaKadam@eyefind.info
EMSTR_356=My name is Saeeda.  I wanted to thank you again for chasing after that man who stole my car. ~nrt~  I am extremely grateful.  It's not the car that matters – I am insured after all – as much as the fact that you stopped to help a person in need.  My family came to the USA 20 years ago with $50 to our name and, thanks to a little hard work and a lot of ruthless business tactics, we now run a very successful tailoring business with supply contracts at many of the high-end department stores, including Ponsonbys.   All too often these days, the American Dream is reserved not for those who love thy neighbor but for those who stab thy neighbor in the back, which leads me to believe that you're probably not a rich man.  Plus I really need to get my karma back on track so, as a small token of my gratitude, I have sent one of our top-selling men's suits to your house.  If it doesn't fit, remember it's the thought that counts.  Take care,Saeeda~nrt~

I hope you don't mind me contacting you out of the blue like this, but I heard that you recently purchased the dock at Paleto Cove.  I don't know if you're aware of the extent of the problems with pollution in San Andreas but nuclear power facilities are pumping large amounts of waste into the ocean on a daily basis.  As a local businessman with a vested interest in the coastline, any assistance that you can personally provide in cleaning up our seabeds would be much appreciated.

EMSTR_523=What am I looking for? If I knew the answer to that I'd save a lot of money on booze and therapy. You spend your life trying to get it all, then when you've got it all you realize you got less than you started with. You know what I mean? I guess that doesn't make too much sense. My kids hate me. My wife hates me. The only time we speak is when we're screaming at each other. So, as you probably can tell, I'm a goodtime guy.
EMSTR_524=RE:RE: It's your lucky day
EMSTR_525=Yeah, well my husband's a selfish dick whose idea of foreplay is to open a beer. He doesn't have the first idea how to satisfy me emotionally or sexually. But we can wallow in our shitty lives or do something about it right? Isn't that what we're doing here? So instead of thinking about your problems, I want you to think LONG AND HARD about the fact that I'm bored and horny, and try to come up with a solution.
EMSTR_526=RE:RE:RE: It's your lucky day
EMSTR_527=I hate to think of you all on your own with nothing to do. Where do you live? Los Santos? Maybe I can give you what you're not getting at home.
EMSTR_528=RE:RE:RE:RE: It's your lucky day
EMSTR_529=Yeah, I live in Los Santos. We'll have to be careful - if my husband catches us he'll kill you.
EMSTR_530=RE:RE:RE:RE:RE: It's your lucky day
EMSTR_531=Don't worry about your husband. You just worry about getting some rest. You're gonna need it.
EMSTR_532=RE:RE:RE:RE:RE:RE: It's your lucky day
EMSTR_533=You're a bad boy. I'm gonna pick out something extra slutty to wear. In the meantime, here's a preview. XXX<img src='img://hush_foxymama21/hush_foxymama21' hspace="70" vspace='0' width='190' height='190'/>

LETTERS_PAGE_ONE=March 15th, 1975~n~~n~ATTN; David Richards~n~~n~My Dear David,~n~~n~Listen, I know you're a little offended by your discovery of my 'petit indiscretion' as the French would say, but I want you to understand – that's all it is – a little indiscretion. I agree whole heartedly with you – my actions were a little inhumane. But that's not a bad thing. Inhumanity is the very watchword, the very currency, the very life blood of the artist! My inhumanity makes me human. It's thanks to my inhumanity that I'm able to speak to people with the moral authority of the sinner and the creator, all at once. I had to kill her. And I had to do it in that way. The way that would hurt me most – by torturing her slowly and painfully, then sending momentos from our date to her family.
LETTERS_PAGE_THREE=He understands nothing about why we act as we do! Not because we can, but because we must. And that's the thing. Some people take advantage of their position in this town for pleasure – as if sleeping with multiple young girls, or torturing hitchhikers or eating dogs could ever be fun? It's awful. I only do it to experience it so my art is truer, deeper, more meaningful, and I believe you know that.~n~~n~I cannot wait for you to read my new draft of LEARED. I have really removed the cliches that ruined Shakespeare's plays and found the power, the moment, the thing we talked about that wonderful night in Mexico when we paid the hookers to stab each other.
LETTERS_PAGE_TWO=And in the years since, I've had to, at times, goad her family into further suffering. Just to prove how very much I understand suffering and how I can represent it best as an artist – isn't it better that one family suffers so the world can be free to enjoy, to learn and to be cleansed by my masterpieces? Don't even bother answering that. The answer is obvious and if you get it wrong, well, then you're less of a man than I thought.~n~~n~But let us not concern ourselves with such trivialities – we are artists, my friend. The last of a dying breed. I dread the day when you finally retire and Solomon takes over – sure I love the kid but he's a remorseless hack with none of your passion, your creative zeal. He's a weak livered moralizer hiding in the body of a Vinewood decadent.
